				<h2>The RCSS was established in 2014 with an endowment provided by Harvey Krueger (CC '61, Law '64).  Our intention is to bring together students and faculty around issues involving science, service, and subjectivity.  The proper study of such issues requires that all participants know what they are seeing, even if what they see is altogether new to them.  We have found that this is difficult, but possible.

				As Rabbi Heschel says: "Our sight is suffused with knowing, instead of feeling painfully the lack of knowing what we see.  The principle to be kept in mind is to know what we see rather than to see what we know."  (Heschel, A. J., "The Prophets, an Introduction," Harper Torchbooks, 1962, p. xi.)</h2>

						<h2>RCSS-TCC Summer Internship Program</h2>
						<hr>

						<h5>
							Terence Cardinal Cooke Hospital (TCC) has a long standing relationship with the RCSS through its Volunteer Programs and Summer Internships.  Initiated in 2013 by Columbia alumnus and Harvard MD candidate Ashley Shaw, the TCC-Columbia relationship has grown and evolved into a successful student run program that now has over 30 "at your service" volunteers and 4 summer clinical interns.  The Columbia undergraduate and graduate students who comprise this group not only gain valuable clinical experience in the intensely rewarding environment of TCC, but they also provide a much needed force of patient centered "caring" for many elderly and under-served individuals at the end of their lives.

				<h4>Can Faith Broaden Reason?</h4>
				<h5>
				Prof. Robert Pollack, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University
				The question, "Can faith broaden reason?" is of such great intrinsic importance, and the risk implied by the possibility that the answer is "no" is so great, that simply to explain why the answer is "yes" is well worth the time and effort. Because this question lies at the boundary of the knowable and the unknowable, it challenges both my faith and my science.
