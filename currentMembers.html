							<h3>Andrea Jurado</h3>
							<h4>Andrea Jurado is a sophomore at Columbia College, intending to major in Biochemistry and concentrating in psychology. (She does not intend to pursue a pre-medical track). Andrea serves as the Webmaster for the Columbia Catholic Ministry and is an active member of the Multicultural Recruitment Committee. She also spends her Fridays teaching science to middle school children through the Columbia Science Outreach. Her passion for the natural sciences has kept her in the laboratory, researching for a cure for cancer. As a high school junior, Andrea helped synthesized an oncoprotein inhibitor at the Chemistry department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In the summer of 2015, she was involved in the characterization of compounds extracted from native Hawaiian plants against breast cancer and glioblastoma cells. Andrea hopes to work for the CDC or NIH in the future, but immediately after college, she plans to join the Peace Corps to serve in Thailand or Cambodia.</h4>

							<h3>Netana Markovitz</h3>
							<h4>Netana Markovitz is a rising junior at Columbia College majoring in English and on the pre-medical track. She is originally from Lexington, Massachusetts. As a summer intern at Terence Cardinal Cooke, the focus of her work has been in the Huntington's Unit. One of the most rewarding parts of the internship for her has been forming lasting relationships with the different residents in the facility. Terence Cardinal Cooke is a special place, and she feels lucky to be a part of it for the summer.</h4>

							<h3>Tess Cersonsky</h3>
							<h4 class="popup-smaller-font">Tess Cersonsky is a rising junior in the Fu Foundation School of Enginnering and Applied Sciences at Columbia University. She is working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Engineering as part of the pre-med program and also is pursuing a minor in music. While at Columbia, she has been involved in a number of organizations. During the 2015-2016 school year, she will co-lead Columbia's chapter of Peer Health Exchange, a non-profit that teaches health classes in city high schools, after serving as a leadership council member and teaching mental health. Tess is the president and co-founder of Nefesh, Columbia/Barnard Hillel's Mental Health awareness group, which has led two annual Mental Health Awareness Months at the Hillel. She is actively involved in Jewish life on campus and seeks through her group involvements to create a space of mental health awareness and acceptance not just at the Hillel, but throughout the Columbia community. In addition to her group involvements, Tess has done research at Yale University as part of the Discovery to Cure Undergraduate Internship Program, a program she also participated in while in high school. Her project “EPAB is required for meiotic competence in mouse oocytes,” was presented at the SEAS Summer Research Symposium at Columbia in October 2014 and at the National Collegiate Research Conference at Harvard University in January 2015.</h4>
